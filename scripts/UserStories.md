User Stories for "David, The Doting Grandfather":US-D1 (David - Simple Start & Clear Guidance): "As David, a grandfather who isn't highly tech-savvy, I want the website to have very large, clear buttons and simple, step-by-step instructions, perhaps with a 'help' tooltip for each section, so I can confidently create a beautiful book for Emily without feeling overwhelmed or needing to ask for help."

US-C2 (Chloe - "Wow-Factor" Personalization): "As Chloe, I want the AI to not just include Lily's name and hobbies, but also subtly weave in her personality traits (like 'brave' or 'curious') into the narrative and the character's expressions in the illustrations, so the gift feels incredibly insightful and wows her parents."

US-C3 (Chloe - Efficient Impressive Gifting): "As Chloe, even if I don't know all of a child's tiny daily details, I want to be able to input the key things I do know (name, age, main interests, a photo) and have the AI assist me in generating a surprisingly rich and impressive story, so I can give a top-tier personalized gift without needing exhaustive information."

US-C4 (Chloe - Shareable Preview/Digital Element): "As Chloe, after I've created the book, I'd love an option to share a cool digital snippet or animated preview of a page on social media (with parents' permission, of course), or easily show it to the parents before the physical gift arrives, so I can share the excitement."
