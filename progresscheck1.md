## Recent Development Activity

Based on the attached logs, the team has been actively working on:

1. **Batch Image Generation**: Successfully processing multiple image requests
2. **Replicate API Integration**: Functional with minimax-image-01 model
3. **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms and error recovery
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time batch processing status updates

**Current Issues Observed**:

- Some batch processing errors with fetch failures
- Batch persistence issues (404 errors for batch lookups)
- Need for improved error recovery in batch operations

## Code Quality and Architecture

### Strengths
